# IZEng
Game engine abstracting away DirectX used inside

## Detailed description
IZEng engine is an open-source game engine of graphics using DirectX. It includes simple trajectory movement primitives: line movement, circle movement with ability to set acceleration, friction (gravity/wind) if needed. It is used by one of my games - RockCarrier. I didn't finish writing documentation, but some aspects are documented. If you have questions, create an issue. I wrote that engine on third course of University, so don't be surprised
